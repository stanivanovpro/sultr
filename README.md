Sultr was my pet project. It was meant to be a booking app where users could book barbers, hardressers, clinics, restaurants, etc.

It was also used for me to onboard with basics of Go and Vue (with Quasar) so that it would be more simple for me to understand the engineers I work with.

I also used it to onboard with Cloud Build and multistage Docker configuration.

I am making the repository public as the project won't ever be released to public :)
